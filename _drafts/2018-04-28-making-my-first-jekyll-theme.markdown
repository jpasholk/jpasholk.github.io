This theme started when I had the idea of converting my portfolio project for freeCodeCamp into a theme. I would get up early before work so I had at least a few hours to dedicate. Get up, make coffee, code.

Repeat.

Somewhere along the line I discovered [UiKit](https://getuikit.com/){:target="_ blank"} and was immediately impressed by the design, it was simple and elegant. Created and maintained by [YooTheme](https://yootheme.com/){:target="_ blank"}, it seemed like a good alternative to Bootstrap for me to explore how to use frameworks. Their documentation was very well laid out with plenty of examples for me to learn from.

This being the first time I've ever created anything like this on my own, it was a big help that they had everything clearly written and documented. This project is about learning first and foremost, I will be documenting everything I've done as best I can. I will be creating new issues with each thing I get stuck on or need help optimizing. It would be great if this could turn into a community project, I invite any and all contributors, as long as they follow the contributor covenant.
