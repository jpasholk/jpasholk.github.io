At the airport, I remember being anxious to get the flight over with. This was actually my first time flying, ever.

## I had the opportunity to attend a tech conference

It wasn't so bad, but I was nervous at first I will admit.

After settling in to our hotel rooms, we set out to check out the town.

It wasn't a long walk from our hotel to the strip. We didn't stay in a fancy place, but it wasn't far.

### Victory meal

We eventually had to stop for something to eat, and this burger place smelled amazing so we went for it.

I ended up buying one that looks a lot like the one on the right. They are amazing to watch and not very expensive.

### At the Conference

When we finally arrived at the conference it wasn't very packed yet as we were actually pretty early.

### Collision Conference booths

There were so many booths that it was impossible to visit every one in the two days of the conference. Especially because each day had different vendors.

### Night on the town

After the first day of the conference, we went out on the town again. This time, we wanted to explore a bit more.

### After thoughts

The second day of the conference was actually pretty boring, we ended up leaving early for an after party which was very fun. I didn't really know anyone there but I felt in good company and entirely safe.

Even though everyone around me were pretty much strangers.
