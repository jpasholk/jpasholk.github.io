## Fox Canyon Trail in Ojai, California

A great little hike that forks off of Shelf Road (Valley View Trail). Its a little bit under 2 miles and a little steep at times with quite a few switchbacks.

Overall it’s a hike that will make you sweat but shouldn’t take all day. You should still pack your hiking hat.

### Looking down on the town of Ojai

You are awarded with views like this as you stop to take a breath. Ojai truly is a beautiful place.

That little red thing is the roof of a house that sits right off of Shelf Road.

### Fox Canyon Trail connects to Pratt Trail

From here the trail splits in two and connects over to Pratt Trail, which is another way to get here.

### Green bark Cianothus

The price of the trail being carved into the hillside for all of us to enjoy. A green bark ceanothus tree just happened to be growing in the way of the trail…

It’s quite beautiful to see the color of it’s wood-flesh.

This is about where we met up with Luci’s Trail. This is looking back toward Fox Canyon.

A sign for Foothill Trail, right to Luci’s Trail, or go straight on to Fuel Break Road which leads over to Gridley Trail.

### Luci's rocky trail

Going down Luci’s Trail is a little rough, it can be touch and go if you’re not careful.

### Phacelia, a plant that can actually cause a poison-oak like rash

Here is my buddy James showing me a plant to avoid called phacelia.

Closer picture of phacelia.

**From Wikipedia:**

>As with many species in the Boraginaceae, contact with the hairs of some species of Phacelia can cause a very unpleasant rash similar to that from poison oak and poison ivy in sensitive individuals. The major contact allergen of Phacelia crenulata has been identified as geranylhydroquinone. The similar-appearing species Eriodictyon parryi (poodle-dog bush), a common chaparral plant of Southern California, is also a frequent cause of skin irritation.

### Native grass sptouting up

Here is a plant that you don’t have to avoid, just because.

### Steep little Switchbacks

Some very steep and tiny switchbacks. What are these? Switchbacks for ants?

### Awesome old water tank

Luci’s Trail winds by an interesting old steel drum of some kind. I assume it used to hold water maybe?
