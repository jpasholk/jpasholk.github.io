Before I met Lila and Dines, the owners of Ojai Home, I had no idea what home staging was. I didn't know what I was missing out on.

## Working for a staging company was one of the coolest experiences of my life

Working for them, I learned a lot about the intangible concepts of design. Especially how a design should make someone happy.

### Huge den with fireplace in the east end of Ojai California

This was in the East End of Ojai California. When we got there, it looked nowhere near this.

### Some like a modern living room

A lot of times clients would want something more modern that suited the buying trends at the time.

### Others, a rustic living room

Other times, a bit more of a traditional design approach is needed to entice buyers in certain situations.

### All glass living room

This was a particularly nice living room that really stood out to me. Sometimes a space demands to be almost left alone with a very minimal touch.

### It's the little things

A lot of the choices a stager makes are small, but add up to something more than the sum of all the parts. This is where the art of the design is.

### Every staging company has a massive amount of pillows

After a good buddy of mine started working with us, we rigged up this pillow storage solution in one of our warehouse spaces.

### My little truck, loaded down

Here is my little Mazda B-3000 loaded down as much as she'd go. Often we'd have both trucks operating on the same job to get everything done quicker.

### Lila's truck loaded with as much as physically possible

All in all I really miss working for OHI Home. The sense of family was very strong from day one, with Lila inviting me over for dinner weekly. Dines, her husband who I actually got the job through, is still one of my favorite people of all time.

Working with him at lynda.com was a really fun experience and I'll cherish the memories we made there. That my friends is a story for another day, and another time.

;P
